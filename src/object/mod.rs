//! Objects within a hardware topology
//!
//! A [`Topology`] is first and foremost a tree of [`TopologyObject`] which
//! represents resource sharing relationships in hardware: an object is
//! considered the parent of all other objects that share the
//! most direct/fastest/lowest-latency route to it. For example, on x86, an L3
//! cache is the parent of a number of L2 caches, each the parent of one L1
//! cache, which is in turn the parent of a CPU core that may or may not be
//! shared by multiple hyperthreads (PUs in hwloc's vocabulary).
//!
//! This module defines the (very extensive) API through which one can query
//! various properties of topology objects and jump from them to other elements
//! of the surrounding topology.

// --- Implementation details ---
//
// Upstream docs:
// - https://hwloc.readthedocs.io/en/v2.9/structhwloc__obj.html
// - https://hwloc.readthedocs.io/en/v2.9/attributes.html
//
// See the matching accessor methods and hwloc documentation for more details on
// field semantics, the struct member documentation will only be focused on
// allowed interactions from methods.
//
// # Safety
//
// As a type invariant, all inner pointers are assumed to be safe to dereference
// and devoid of mutable aliases if the TopologyObject is reachable at all.
//
// This is enforced through the following precautions:
//
// - No API exposes an owned TopologyObjects, only references to it bound by
//   the source topology's lifetime are exposed.
// - APIs for interacting with topologies and topology objects honor Rust's
//   shared XOR mutable aliasing rules, with no internal mutability.
//
// Provided that objects do not link to other objects outside of the topology
// they originate from, which is minimally sane expectation from hwloc, this
// should be enough.
//
// The hwloc_obj has very complex consistency invariants that are not fully
// documented by upstream. We assume the following:
//
// - If any pointer is non-null, its target can be assumed to be valid
// - Anything that is not explicitly listed as okay to modify below should be
//   considered unsafe to modify unless proven otherwise
// - object_type is assumed to be in sync with attr
// - It is okay to change attr inner data as long as no union is switched
//   from one variant to another
// - subtype may be replaced with another C string allocated by malloc(),
//   which hwloc will automatically free() on topology destruction (source:
//   documentation of hwloc_topology_insert_group_object() encourages it).
//   However, this is only safe if hwloc is linked against the same libc as the
//   application, so it should be made unsafe on Windows where linking against
//   two different CRTs is both easy to do and hard to avoid.
// - depth is in sync with parent
// - logical_index is in sync with (next|prev)_cousin
// - sibling_rank is in sync with (next|prev)_sibling
// - arity is in sync with (children|(first|last)_child)
// - symmetric_subtree is in sync with child pointers
// - memory_arity is in sync with memory_first_child
// - io_arity is in sync with io_first_child
// - misc_arity is in sync with misc_first_child
// - infos_count is in sync with infos
// - userdata should not be touched as topology duplication aliases it
// - gp_index is stable by API contract
