// --- Implementation details ---
//
// Since the Topology API is _huge_, not all of it is implemented in the
// topology module. Instead, functionality which is very strongly related to
// one other code module is implemented inside that module, leaving this module
// focused on basic lifecycle and cross-cutting issues.
//
// # Safety
//
// As a type invariant, the inner pointer is assumed to always point to a valid
// fully built, non-aliased topology.
//
// Any binding to an hwloc topology function that takes a user-provided
// &TopologyObject parameter **must** check that this object does belongs to the
// topology using the Topology::contains() method before passing it to hwloc.
