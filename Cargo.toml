[features]
# Require the latest release of hwloc supported by this library
#
# It is not recommended to use this feature in production, since an update to
# hwlocality can silently bump your hwloc build requirement. But this feature is
# convenient for scenarios like CI where you want to test with all features on.
hwloc-latest = ["hwloc-2_10_0"]

# Require at least hwloc v2.0.4, which enables...
#
# - Checking if the merging of group objects with identical parents or children
#   has been prevented.
hwloc-2_0_4 = ["hwlocality-sys/hwloc-2_0_4"]

# Require at least hwloc v2.1.0, which enables...
#
# - Support for ObjectType::Die, used to model CPUs with multiple dies per package.
# - Support for ObjectType::MemCache, used to model memory-side caches.
# - Blacklisting some components from being enabled in a topology via
#   TopologyBuilder::blacklist_component(), for faster topology loading.
#
# ...in addition to all features listed above
hwloc-2_1_0 = ["hwlocality-sys/hwloc-2_1_0", "hwloc-2_0_4"]

# Require at least hwloc v2.2.0, which enables...
#
# - Removing SMT from a given CpuSet using CpuSet::singlify_per_core.
# - PCI devices with 32-bit domain indices. Since we currently can't tell which
#   configuration was used in the hwloc build, we assume the default
#   configuration, which is to disable it until v3.0 where it becomes the default.
#
# ...in addition to all features listed above
hwloc-2_2_0 = ["hwlocality-sys/hwloc-2_2_0", "hwloc-2_1_0"]

# Require at least hwloc v2.3.0, which enables...
#
# - Memory attributes, allowing latency/bandwidth queries between initiators
#   (e.g. CPU cores) and NUMA nodes.
# - Topology::local_numa_nodes() for listing NUMA nodes that are local to some
#   locality.
# - Export of support information in XML, which can be read back by setting the
#   new BuildFlags::IMPORT_SUPPORT flag.
# - Modifying topologies using TopologyEditor. This was actually supported by
#   previous hwloc versions, but in a manner that violates the Rust aliasing
#   model so we could not expose it in the Rust bindings.
#
# ...in addition to all features listed above
hwloc-2_3_0 = ["hwlocality-sys/hwloc-2_3_0", "hwloc-2_2_0"]

# Require at least hwloc v2.4.0, which enables...

#
# ...in addition to all features listed above
hwloc-2_4_0 = ["hwlocality-sys/hwloc-2_4_0", "hwloc-2_3_0"]

# Require at least hwloc v2.5.0, which enables...
#
# - Querying Windows processor groups.
# - Converting between objects with same locality, e.g. NUMA nodes and Packages,
#   using Topology::object_with_same_locality.
# - Modifying distance structures using Distances::transform()
# - Adding distances between objects using TopologyEditor::add_distances(). This
#   was actually possible in previous versions of hwloc, but the old API was
#   quite different, and is not currently supported by the Rust bindings.
# - New BuildFlags to prevent modifications of CPU and memory bindings during
#   topology discovery, especially on Windows.
#
# ...in addition to all features listed above
hwloc-2_5_0 = ["hwlocality-sys/hwloc-2_5_0", "hwloc-2_4_0"]

# Require at least hwloc v2.8.0, which enables...

#   to speed up topology building when they are not needed.
# - Dedicated memory attributes for read and write bandwidth and latency, rather
#   than an overall figure of merit.
#
# ...in addition to all features listed above
hwloc-2_8_0 = ["hwlocality-sys/hwloc-2_8_0", "hwloc-2_5_0"]

# API, but cleans up hwlocality internals.

# ...in addition to all features listed above

# To support a new hwloc release that introduces API or ABI changes (see the
# NEWS file in the hwloc source tree for release notes)...
#
# - Add a new feature matching that release version.
# - Make it enable features associated with all previous versions.
# - Change hwloc-latest to point to that feature.
# - Update hwlocality-sys' Cargo.toml similarly
# - Update hwlocality-sys' build.rs to...
#   * Record the new feature's hwloc version requirements in `setup_hwloc()`
#   * Use a newer official tarball, with appropriate checksum (can be computed
#     using `curl <tar.gz url> | sha3-256sum`), in `setup_vendored_hwloc()`
#   * If this is a new major version, add support for it in `find_hwloc()`
# - Make the binding honor the API/ABI changes with the right cfg()s.
# - Bump the crate's minor release number unless previous version was unreleased.
# - Add this feature to the CI's linter matrix and both test matrices.
# - Once CI has run at least once, add new matrix entry to required checks.
# - Bump the hwloc version that's installed by CI.
# - Adjust readthedocs links to point to the new release's documentation.
# - Tag new minor releases of hwlocality and hwlocality-sys

# Otherwise, hwlocality will use the system installation of hwloc.

# By default, hwloc is built with all optional features disabled, which
# minimizes the odds of hard-to-debug vendored build failures. You may instead
# let the hwloc build system automatically enable optional features, as it does
# by default, using the "vendored-extra" cargo feature.

# e.g. CUDA support may end up being enabled even when the relevant CUDA toolkit
# is not in PATHs, resulting in hwloc build failures.
