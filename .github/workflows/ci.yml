# There are two kinds of continuous integration jobs in this project:
#
# - Every code submission or master push passes continuous integration on the
#   minimal supported Rust version and the current stable Rust version.
# - Two times a month, a scheduled job makes sure that the code remains
#   compatible and lint-free on upcoming Rust toolchains (beta and nightly).

  #        are additive and almost solely (*cough cough* add_distances *cough
  #        cough*) add new features to test without removing any.
  #
  #        Unfortunately, `cargo check` does not currently check doctests
  #        (see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6424 ), so we need to
  #        test each version individually to make sure that doctests for a

  #        hwloc versions (which would force people to needlessly up their hwloc
  #        version requirements if they want to follow the doc examples).
